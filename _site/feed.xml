&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make a &lt;strong&gt;container&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;strong&gt;row&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Define the column space for each box. There are &lt;strong&gt;12 columns&lt;/strong&gt; in each row.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you can make a row with 4 boxes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3&quot;&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Box 1&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3&quot;&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Box 2&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3&quot;&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Box 3&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3&quot;&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Box 4&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classes to set the column width are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;col-sm-12&lt;/strong&gt;: on an extra small screen device (phone) the column width will be equal to the row width, i.e. all boxes will be below one another in a single column.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_DF3E6D2DF13A1AA1C63387C5F183F8D88C261ACC49255C9841C23B8F107E7FE6_1504274678701_Screenshot+2017-09-01+11.03.50.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;col-sm-6&lt;/strong&gt;: on a small device (tablet) the column width will be 6, so there are 2 columns with 2 boxes each.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_DF3E6D2DF13A1AA1C63387C5F183F8D88C261ACC49255C9841C23B8F107E7FE6_1504274703571_Screenshot+2017-09-01+11.04.02.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;col-md-3&lt;/strong&gt;: on a medium device (laptop or desktop) the width will be 3, showing the boxes on a single row.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_DF3E6D2DF13A1AA1C63387C5F183F8D88C261ACC49255C9841C23B8F107E7FE6_1504274718642_Screenshot+2017-09-01+11.04.10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The installation was actually pretty straightforward. But then you’re stuck with a generic blog template and have no idea how to customize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing a new theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being used to WordPress I mistakenly thought that I just would have to import some theme zip file, adjust some settings in the config file and commit the changes. Would that it were so simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some themes can be installed using a ruby gem. I tried doing this with several themes on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-themes&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;, but with little success. Another option that was suggested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31327045/switch-theme-in-an-existing-jekyll-installation&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; involved making a branch of the existing git repository, pulling in the new theme and then merging the changes. This seems like the correct way of handling a theme change, but a bit complex for someone just getting started with Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I just found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; I liked, cloned it to a local directory and started customising it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I had cloned the repo, it was still linked to the original remote of the theme developer. To publish it with GitHub Pages I needed to link it to my own remote. I’m sure there’s a better way to do this, but I just made a new directory copied all the files into it and initiated a new git repo. Then I added my own remote to publish the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did I choose Jekyll to build my site?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason I initially became interested in Jekyll is that it allows you to build a minimalist static site. Even though this proved to be harder than I thought, it was a good learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an aspiring developer Jekyll is actually the perfect way to build a site. It forces you to use essential developer tools like the command line, Git and a (markdown) text editor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Miguel Tavares</name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="git" /><category term="github" /><summary type="html">Ok, I have to admit it took me some time to set up this site using Jekyll.

The main objective is to be able to reference my learning trajectory and get an overview of where I am and how I got there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me start at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-did-i-get-the-idea-to-become-a-developer&quot;&gt;When did I get the idea to become a developer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I am working as a support agent for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://appmachine.com&quot;&gt;software company&lt;/a&gt;, I did not aspire to become a developer. I enjoyed technology, but always fancied myself more of a consumer than a creator. Developers were like these mythical creatures, able to solve impossibly abstract problems. Joining their ranks did not seem like a real option to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This changed when I read an &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/prog&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Derek Sivers. In a world ruled by technology, he said, you should at least know the basics of how that technology works. TL;DR everyone should learn programming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the main sites that I have used so far to learn how to code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/&quot;&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;: very easy to get started and I liked that from the beginning you learn by solving little code challenges. The difficulty level does ramp up significantly though. In particular the projects you have to do by yourself can be hard, because you go from a guided learning process to suddenly having to build something on your own from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/&quot;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;: best online courses I found so far. Really nice layout and well thought out learning process. I did buy the Pro version to get access to the quizzes and projects. They are currently updating the courses, so some older courses are a bit outdated. This is where I first learned Ruby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://udacity.com&quot;&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt;: not quite as good as Codecademy, but good to reference for specific doubts I had about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theodinproject.com/&quot;&gt;The Odin Project&lt;/a&gt;: currently I am going through this open source curriculum. Nice thing about this course is that you’re not coding in a closed environment and are forced to learn development tools from the beginning, like the command line and Git. They also reference a lot of great online resources on each subject that I’m bookmarking for later use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online courses really helped me make up my mind that this the path I want to pursue and gave me basic knowledge of the full development stack. Still I wanted something that would help accelerate my learning. So after doing some research I decided…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…to join the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lewagon.com&quot;&gt;Le Wagon&lt;/a&gt; developer bootcamp!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be starting at the end of September in the Lisbon batch.
