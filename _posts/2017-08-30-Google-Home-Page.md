As part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) curriculum I had to replicate the Google home page using html and css. You can see the result [here](http://migueltavar.es/google-homepage/).

The most difficult part was figuring out how to add the top and bottom navigation bars. There are many different ways to do this, for example using the html5 `<nav>` tag. I just used a regular unordered list `<ul>` with `<li>` items. Then I removed all the styling in css.

This video was really helpful:
